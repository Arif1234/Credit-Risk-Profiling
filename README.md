# Credit Risk Profiling
> This project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing loan default rates within a consumer finance company. By employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we will analyze historical loan data to identify key attributes that correlate with loan repayment behavior. The insights derived from this analysis will enable the company to construct a robust credit risk model, aiding in the assessment of loan applicants and mitigating financial losses due to defaults. Ultimately, this project seeks to optimize lending decisions and enhance overall portfolio performance.

## General Information
- The project is centered around the domain of risk analytics within the consumer finance industry. It aims to address the critical challenge of loan defaults, which significantly impacts a lending company's profitability. By employing data-driven methods, we seek to identify patterns and trends in loan applicant data that can predict the likelihood of default.
- The primary business problem is to minimize credit loss by accurately identifying loan applicants who are at a higher risk of default. This involves building a predictive model to assess creditworthiness and inform lending decisions, such as loan approval, interest rate determination, and loan amount.
- Loan Dataset provided by upGrad is used here.
